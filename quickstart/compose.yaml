# STRIPPED-DOWN VERSION FOR STRATOS INFRASTRUCTURE
# =================================================
# This is a minimal cn-quickstart deployment that runs only the Canton infrastructure.
# The backend-service, frontend, and related components have been removed because
# Stratos apps (stratos-vault, stratos-rwa, stratos-swap) provide their own UI and
# backend via Cloudflare Pages/Functions.
#
# Removed components:
#   - backend/ (Java Spring Boot app)
#   - frontend/ (React app)
#   - docker/backend-service/
#   - docker/register-app-user-tenant/
#   - config/nginx/
#   - docker/modules/observability/
#   - docker/modules/keycloak/
#   - integration-test/
#
# What remains:
#   - Canton participant nodes (canton container)
#   - Splice validator services (splice container)
#   - PostgreSQL database (postgres container)
#   - Participant Query Store (pqs-app-provider container)
#   - Splice onboarding scripts (splice-onboarding container)
#
# See DEPLOYMENT.md and ARCHITECTURE.md for full documentation.

# No application-level services in this stripped-down version.
# All services are defined in docker/modules/localnet/compose.yaml
